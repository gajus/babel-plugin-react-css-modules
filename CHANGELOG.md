### v6.0.0

BREAKING CHANGE:

Incompatible with `css-modules < 3.6.0`

Explanation: starting from `3.6.0`, css-modules uses `\x00` instead of `+` when generating `content.options` consumed by Webpack when generating `[hash]` and `[contenthash]`, as can be seen in [this update](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/commit/d2f6bd2755a513e98faca84c3f52544be72d53f3#diff-3274f1a37032fb0ae4e2823def0007c634e869ae0dfc304ff6a12c36513c3a52R49). As a result, the hash value generated by this plugin prior to `v6` was not the same as the one generated by Webpack's `css-loader`.

### v5.0.0

BREAKING CHANGE:
* exclude logic is used to exclude JSXElement containing files
